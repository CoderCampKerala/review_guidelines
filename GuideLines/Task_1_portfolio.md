- Assess their **basic Git knowledge**:
  - Do they understand repositories, feature branch, commits, push and pull request?
- Request **project explanation**:
  - What have they built ?
  - What challenges did they face?
  - How did they structure their code?

### **2. Teaching Key Debugging Skills**
- Show them how to **inspect their own project** using browser DevTools:
  - Right-click on the webpage → **Inspect**.

  - Explain how to check **console errors** in the **Console** tab.
  - Demonstrate how to view **network requests** in the **Network** tab.
- Teach them how to **edit and preview CSS changes live** in DevTools.
- Emphasize the importance of code formatting in their editor for readability and maintainability.


### **3. Improving Their Coding Workflow**
- Introduce essential **VS Code plugins** :
  - **Prettier** (code formatting)
  - **ESLint** (code quality checks)
- Explain **how to structure their project effectively**:
  - Organizing code into meaningful folders.

- Explain the **differences between static and dynamic applications**.

### **5. Deploying Their Project on GitHub Pages**
1. Guide them to navigate to **GitHub Repository Settings** → **Pages**.
2. Enable deployment and select the correct branch.
3. Show them how to check the deployment status in the **Actions** tab.
4. Once deployed, demonstrate how to access their project via the **live URL**.

### **6. Evaluating Their Progress**
- If they **lack basic Git knowledge** or **cannot complete a simple portfolio site**, ask them to **repeat the project for another week**.
- Encourage them to document their learnings and improve upon their previous work.

### **7. Encouragement and Next Steps**
- Acknowledge their progress so far and motivate them to keep improving.
- Provide constructive feedback on what they can enhance in their next project.
- Set expectations for their next milestone (e.g., making the page responsive, adding interactivity with JavaScript, etc.).
